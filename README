Tecsbot originally started out as a Twitch Emote Chat Statistics Bot, hence TECSBOT. It was just an idea I had for a bot to keep track of the number of emotes total in the given channel, however after I would have been finished with it, I decided to take it farther. It now has multiple features including autoreplies, antispam, votes, and much more. However, at the moment Tecsbot is very WIP, and it needs a lot more improvement before I will be putting it up on a server and letting other streamers use it. 

At the time of this README, the bot is run in Python 2.7, using multiple libraries, with Twisted at it's core. Using the Twitch API as well as these libraries, I am working to make it the best general purpose chat and moderation bot I can make it. 

I hope the code in this repository can help other bot developers get around problems they might face, as I did.
